# Linked-List-Enrollment
Linked Lists are crucial to data management, in this project, students are offered an enrollment program which determines if
a student has the credentials to enroll in a course
In this assignment, we must created courses and set-up the data in a list. 

## Syllabus File
We are given a `Syllabus.txt` file which contains multiple courses (including duplicated) with various information such as **course ID, credits & more**

## Request File
Furthermore, students' requested courses are stored in a `Request.txt` file. After reading the file, we must compare the courses listed in `Request.txt` and `Syllabus` to determine if a student has the correct pre-requisite & co-requisite courses to enroll.
